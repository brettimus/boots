This is a collection of shell setup scripts.

Several scripts relate to changing the terminal theme on the fly.

The themes are sourced from: https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/ghostty

The `theme-*.sh` files demonstrate how to write a script that changes colors of the terminal.

After adding a new theme, put it into `aliases.sh`

Always ask the end user to test the theme instead of executing these scripts yourself.
